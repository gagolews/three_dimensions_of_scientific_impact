> *What are the mechanisms behind one’s research success as measured by one’s papers’ citability? By acknowledging the perceived esteem might be a consequence not only of how valuable one’s works are but also of pure luck, we arrived at a model that can accurately recreate a citation record based on just three parameters: the number of publications, the total number of citations, and the degree of randomness in the citation patterns. As a by-product, we show that a single index will never be able to embrace the complex reality of the scientific impact. However, three of them can already provide us with a reliable summary.*
